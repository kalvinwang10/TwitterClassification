Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets....

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad! 503TrumpMon Aug 15 01:34:25 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
"Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents! 503TrumpMon Aug 15 00:07:43 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! 503TrumpSun Aug 14 23:57:37 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false! 503TrumpSun Aug 14 17:06:20 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it! 503TrumpSun Aug 14 16:55:07 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose! 503TrumpSun Aug 14 16:50:51 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm. 503TrumpSun Aug 14 12:46:17 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20% 503TrumpSun Aug 14 12:37:37 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said 503TrumpSun Aug 14 12:31:23 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary! 503TrumpSun Aug 14 12:24:48 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime

In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy! 503TrumpTue Jul 26 22:47:28 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. 503TrumpTue Jul 26 19:48:08 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime

Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great 503TrumpTue Jul 26 12:38:27 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference 503TrumpTue Jul 26 12:34:19 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. 503TrumpTue Jul 26 03:19:38 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! 503TrumpTue Jul 26 03:12:57 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime

Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! 503TrumpMon Jul 25 21:45:54 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! 503TrumpMon Jul 25 13:42:55 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie. 503TrumpMon Jul 25 13:19:18 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. 503TrumpMon Jul 25 12:27:35 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 503TrumpMon Jul 25 12:26:56 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! 503TrumpMon Jul 25 12:02:01 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! 503TrumpMon Jul 25 11:57:17 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me 503TrumpMon Jul 25 11:31:22 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 23:59:10 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 23:47:08 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 22:33:42 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 22:16:59 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 22:07:49 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out 503TrumpSun Jul 24 22:02:42 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild 503TrumpSun Jul 24 21:53:29 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 20:45:31 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 20:30:06 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) 503TrumpSun Jul 24 20:20:57 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 13:30:59 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 13:27:56 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. 503TrumpSun Jul 24 12:30:15 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 12:15:51 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 11:56:43 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT 503TrumpSun Jul 24 11:25:06 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! 503TrumpSun Jul 24 11:16:15 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime

I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! 503TrumpSat Jul 23 16:06:15 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! 503TrumpSat Jul 23 15:36:41 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! 503TrumpSat Jul 23 15:01:48 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. 503TrumpSat Jul 23 14:51:32 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED 503TrumpSat Jul 23 10:55:20 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! 503TrumpSat Jul 23 10:42:10 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! 503TrumpSat Jul 23 10:35:37 +0000 2016 503TrumpTime
