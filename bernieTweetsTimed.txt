In my view, we need to repeal the 1996 welfare reform provisions and expand, not weaken, the social safety net. 503BernieFri Apr 08 23:33:28 +0000 2016 503BernieTime
In 2008, @HillaryClinton said that “welfare should not be an anti-poverty program.” I disagree. 503BernieFri Apr 08 23:24:30 +0000 2016 503BernieTime
This legislation has weakened the social safety net and increased extreme poverty. That is unacceptable. 503BernieFri Apr 08 23:22:51 +0000 2016 503BernieTime
This legislation gave Republican governors like Scott Walker the responsibility to provide a safety net for families in need. 503BernieFri Apr 08 23:21:46 +0000 2016 503BernieTime

It turns out that the welfare reform bill has been an absolute disaster. 503BernieFri Apr 08 23:00:49 +0000 2016 503BernieTime
Unfortunately, @HillaryClinton supported this bill calling it “a critical first step to reforming our nation’s welfare system.” 503BernieFri Apr 08 22:57:03 +0000 2016 503BernieTime
